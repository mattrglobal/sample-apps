    "description": "# Introduction\nThe MATTR VII API defines a set of capabilities that can be used to manage and interact with a MATTR VII tenant. This includes managing a Verifiable Credential across its lifecycle (issue-hold-verify) as well as various tenant administration and management tasks such as setting up a custom domain, creating DIDs and configuring issuance and verification workflows.\nRefer to our [API Changelog](https://learn.mattr.global/docs/vii-platform/api-change-log) to see changes from previous versions.\n\n# Getting Started with our APIs\nAs a MATTR VII user, you are provided with the following details, required for accessing and engaging with your MATTR VII tenant:\n\n``` json\n{\n\"audience\": \"YOUR_AUDIENCE_URL\",\n\"url\": \"YOUR_AUTH_URL\",\n\"tenant_subdomain\": \"YOUR_TENANT_SUBDOMAIN\",\n\"client_id\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\",\n\"client_secret\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\"\n}\n```\n\n> If you have not received your tenant details or have questions, please [contact us](https://mattr.global/contact/) before proceeding.\n\nUse the `tenant_subdomain` value provided with your tenant details to construct a URL of the following structure:\n\n``` http\nhttps://{YOUR_TENANT_SUBDOMAIN}.vii.au01.mattr.global\n```\n\nThis is the base URL you should use for all requests to your tenant, suffixed by the endpoint route detailed for the specific API you are calling.\n\n> MATTR trial tenants are hosted on servers in Australia by default. If you are a customer and requested your tenant to be hosted in a different region, the `au01` element in your URL should be replaced with a different value to correspond with your requested region. Please [contact us](https://mattr.global/contact/) if you are unsure what region to use.\n\n# Pagination\nMost list operations in the API enable cursor pagination using the `cursor` and `limit` query parameters:\n\n**Example on [Retrieve List of Credentials](#operation/retrieveListCreds)**\n```\nGET https://{tenant-url}/core/v2/credentials\n?limit=100\n&cursor=Y3JlYXRlZEF0PTIwMjAtMTAtMDhUMjMlM0ExMyUzQTE3Ljg5NtZGUxZWEyNzQ4MWI4\n```\n\n* `limit`: determines how many entries are returned in that request, with a maximum value of 1000.\n* `cursor`: sets the location in the retrieved list to get the next batch of entries from. This is based on the returned `nextCursor`, found at the beginning of each returned range and identifies the last object in the list.\n\nRequesting an entry after the last list value will return an empty `data` object:\n\n``` json\n{\n\"data\": []\n}\n```\n\nNot providing a query parameter defaults the response to return the first range of entries with a `limit` of 100.\n\n# Authorization\nAccess to the API is granted by our authorization provider. Use the `client_id` and `client_secret` provided with your tenant details to [make a request](#operation/authToken) to receive a bearer token from the auth provider. This token must then be used as an `authorization` header for all requests to protected endpoints (this is required for the majority of operations).\n\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n\n\nContact Support:\n Email: support@mattr.global",

This capability is no longer actively enhanced or supported and will be removed from the MATTR VII platform on 19 Aug 2024. It is highly recommended to issue [Compact Semantic Credentials](https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/create/compact-credentials/create-semantic-compact) instead.\nConvert a document like a JSON-LD Credential or a Verifiable Presentation into a CBOR-LD document, and vice versa.\n\nThe Convert operation can accept JSON-LD documents as an input and convert them to a CBOR-LD document represented in Base64. \nCBOR-LD documents can represent the same information in a smaller size that is more friendly for offline use-cases, such as embedding into a QR code printed onto physical media or a PDF.\n\nDocuments can also be converted from CBOR-LD in Base64 format to JSON-LD, the response can either be encoded in Base 64 or plain JSON. This is useful for accepting compressed Credentials or Verifiable Presentations and converting them for use on other operations like [Verify a Credential](#operation/verify-credential) or [Verify a Presentation](#operation/verifyPres).\n\n**Wallet Presentations**  \nThe MATTR mobile wallet can create verifiable presentations from a single credential in a CBOR-LD format and encode this into a QR, a further layer of GZip compression is performed.\n\n**Limitations**  \nCalculating the exact size of a credential/document that can be encoded into a QR and safely read by a camera is not straightforward. Larger credentials are unlikely to work, including those with embedded images (photos), large nested claims, or credentials with large signatures like BBS, it is generally best to confirm by testing across a range of devices.\n\nDeeply nested JSON-LD structures are currently unable to be converted to CBOR-LD due to limitations of the library, so it is possible to see errors.\n\nWe are aware that inline contexts may affect the performance for CBOR-LD compression. The Create Credential endpoint uses an inline `@vocab` context, this may change in the future.\n\n### **Analytic events**\n* LINKED_DATA_CONVERT_STARTLINKED_DATA_CONVERT_START\n* LINKED_DATA_CONVERT_STARTLINKED_DATA_CONVERT_SUCCESS\n* LINKED_DATA_CONVERT_STARTLINKED_DATA_CONVERT_FAIL"

This could be gathering more information, performing additional authentication steps (E.g, 2FA, MFA or biometric checks) or communicating the terms of service. To facilitate this requirement, you can configure MATTR VII to invoke an interaction hook which will redirect the user to a custom component during the credential issuance journey. This redirect happens **after** the user is authenticated with your configured identity provider but **before** the credential is issued to the user. Upon successful completion of the interaction hook, your custom component will redirect the user back to their digital wallet to complete the credential issuance flow. Your interaction hook component can be either a web or native application.  We recommend using a web interface because it's more compatible with most scenarios.\n> You can only configure one interaction hook on your MATTR VII tenant. If you require several custom interactions as part of the credential issuance workflow, they should all be linked into a single interaction hook component.\n\n### **Analytic events**\n* CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_OPENID_CONFIGURATION_UPDATE_START\n* CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_OPENID_CONFIGURATION_UPDATE_SUCCESS\n* CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_OPENID_CONFIGURATION_UPDATE_FAIL"
