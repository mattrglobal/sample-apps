## For designers

Download the [design package file](./_forDesigners/InDesignPackageFile.zip) to see how the PDF is structured and generated via InDesign. You can also use this file as the base for your own templates.

## For developers

Work with the designers so the fields key on config.json is the same as the form fields on the PDF template

The corresponding payload file can be found on [./payload.json](./payload.json)
